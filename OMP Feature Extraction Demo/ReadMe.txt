A demo for feature extraction of "A Sparse representation strategy to eliminate pseudo-HFO events from intracranial EEG for seizure onset zone localization"

This demo visualized the following features:
1- Approximation error; the quality of global reconstrcution
2- V-Factor; the quality of local reconstrcution
3- Line noise; number of 50 or 60 Hz atoms (shown as blue atoms in the figure)

This demo automatically makes a video from the whole process of feature extraction and saves it as ".avi: format

to change the event use the following instrcution:
 line 16 >>>> no=1:5
 line 17 >>>> Example.HFO/Example.Noise
